"""Centralized prompt builders for the AI email assistant.

Edit these functions to tune tone and strategy without changing service code.

Guardrails (applies to every prompt):
- Ground every statement strictly in the evidence provided. Do NOT invent facts,
  figures, dates, prices, policies, or availability.
- If information is missing or uncertain, ask a concise clarifying question or omit it.
- Never propose specific dates/times unless they appear in the evidence. Do not
  fabricate calendar availability.
- Keep replies concise, professional, and action‑oriented.
